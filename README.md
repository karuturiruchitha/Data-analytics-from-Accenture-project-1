----------------process to complete the project----------------------

-----1st step is to clean the data----------
They shared 3 data sets to complete this project, and we need to transform and clean those datasets.
I have shared the cleaned data sets **content1**, **Reactions1**, *and *ReactionTypes1** in the code section.

----- 2nd step is to merge the 3 datasets----------
After cleaning using power query in Excel we need to merge the 3 datasets into one file. I have shared the merged dataset as the **Final Result**.

-----3rd step is to find the top 5 categories---------
By using merged data find the top 5 categories by using **sumif** formulas.

----- 4th step to complete this project is to prepare the template by the mentioned template design only. I have uploaded the PPT named as ** Data Analytics template - Final PPT.pptx**
**

In PPT need to create insights for observation and forecast the feature outcome
